# Running apps on Enclava

Enclava runs container images as **confidential workloads**: a Kata VM-backed guest
(AMD SEV-SNP) where the host can schedule and operate the workload but cannot read its
memory or silently alter its trusted startup path. Secrets and encrypted state are
released *inside* the guest only after image-signature, policy, and attestation checks
pass. Everything a user does goes through the `enclava` CLI (or the hosted console).

Use `enclava <command> --help` to discover the current surface, but treat help text as
a pointer rather than proof: when an executable or security claim matters, verify it
against observed behavior or the current implementation.

## The model in five facts

1. **Manual OCI apps use `enclava.toml`** (`enclava init` scaffolds it); hosted apps
   come from platform templates. `create` may resolve a tag, but `deploy` requires a
   **digest-pinned image** (`image@sha256:<digest>`).
2. **Custom images need portable cosign signature and bound provenance material**, and
   the signer identity is pinned per app (`--signer-subject` at create, or
   `enclava signer set` later). Keyless GitHub Actions signing is the intended path.
3. **Persistent storage is encrypted** (LUKS inside the guest). In password mode the
   owner holds a password and a BIP39 recovery mnemonic; the platform cannot read the
   volume.
4. **`enclava status` is the source of truth** — it reports runtime status, TEE unlock
   state, and `tee_error` (the in-guest startup failure reason) without needing cluster
   access. Read it before theorizing.
5. **Fail-closed is correct behavior.** When verification can't complete, startup
   blocks or the deploy fails rather than proceeding unverified. Explain this; never
   improvise workarounds around a verification failure.

## Secret-handling discipline (always)

- Storage passwords and recovery mnemonics are **owner secrets**. Never echo them into
  logs, shell history, or files beyond what the user asked for. Prefer
  `--storage-password-file` on a tight-permissions file over inline arguments.
- The mnemonic is shown **once** at claim time. By default the CLI persists it locally
  so `enclava key backup` covers it; export a backup outside the project immediately
  after the first deploy (`enclava key backup --out "$HOME/.enclava/my-app-recovery.json"`).
- If a password-mode app has neither a usable password nor a recovery mnemonic/backup,
  the platform cannot recover its data. Auto-unlock is not a substitute for an owner
  backup.

## Unlock state machine (core of the platform)

Password mode (the default):

- **First deploy** waits for the TEE bootstrap endpoint, then the owner **claims**
  ownership: set a password, receive the BIP39 mnemonic (shown once). With
  `deploy --storage-password-file PATH` this happens automatically and non-interactively.
- **Every restart** boots to `locked`; unlock it with the password
  (`enclava unlock [--app NAME]`, interactive). On the manual OCI path, a complete
  redeploy command can instead supply the same `--storage-password-file`.
- **`enclava recover --mnemonic-file M --new-password-file P`** re-wraps the seed under
  a new password after a lost password. It requires a **freshly booted, locked TEE** —
  against a long-running pod it fails `recovery_requires_locked_init_verifier`; restart
  the workload first. After a successful recover, storage is already unlocked — a
  follow-up `enclava unlock` reporting "not locked" is expected.
- **`enclava change-password`** re-wraps under a new password (needs the old one).

Auto-unlock (manual OCI apps only, for unattended restarts):

- A **first deploy must be password mode** because no owner seed exists before claim;
  current `create` rejects `unlock.mode = "auto"` up front. Deploy password-first,
  then run `enclava auto-unlock enable --image <image>@sha256:<digest>`. This wraps
  the owner seed for **KBS-attestation-gated release**: KBS returns the encrypted
  envelope only to a guest that passes attestation; it is not TEE-hardware sealing.
  The command also binds the digest into a signed redeploy descriptor.
  `enclava auto-unlock disable --image <image>@sha256:<digest>` returns to
  password-on-restart. Both transitions currently require local `enclava.toml`, so
  hosted template apps cannot use them.

Known hard failure — **stale escrow**: if an app is destroyed while its pod was already
dead, the key escrow survives; recreating an app with the **same name** inherits it —
claim returns `already_claimed` and every unlock silently lands wrong-password
(`TEE: locked`, no error). The fix is recovering with the *old* app's mnemonic, which
still matches the surviving envelope.

## Command map (verified surface)

| Area | Commands |
| --- | --- |
| Auth | Hosted/device flow: `login [--api-url] [--no-browser] [--org] [--approve-logs]`, `whoami`, `logout`. Standalone CAP only: `signup`, `login --nostr`, `login --email`. |
| Scaffold | `init` (interactive; detects a Dockerfile when present, otherwise defaults the port to 3000), `prepare` (non-interactive *first* run only — on existing output files it prompts, which dies non-TTY; no `--yes` yet) |
| Deploy | `create [--image] [--signer-subject] [--signer-issuer]`, `deploy --image IMG@DIGEST [--set K=V] [--set-file K=PATH] [--storage-password-file PATH]` |
| Observe | `status [--app]`, `logs [--app] [-f] [--log-private-key-file PATH]`, `log-key generate/list/select/revoke` |
| Config | `config set K=V…` (local `enclava.toml`; no `--app`), `config get` (names only), `config unset K` |
| Templates | `template list`, `template deploy [slug] --name N [--ssh-public-key-file PATH]`, `template ssh-command --name N --wait [--json]` |
| Ownership | `claim`, `unlock`, `recover`, `change-password`, `auto-unlock enable/disable` |
| Lifecycle | `rollback [--to ID]`, `destroy [--app] [--force]` |
| Identity | `signer set/rotate`, `org create/switch/invite/members/keyring`, `key status/backup/restore/setup/rotate-owner` |
| Domains | `domains add/verify/list/remove` |

Commands that expose `--app` can address a named hosted or manual app. Commands such
as `create`, generic `deploy`, `config set`, and `auto-unlock` instead require local
`enclava.toml`; check the selected journey before assuming `--app` exists.

## Pick the journey

Read exactly one reference (they carry the detail; this file is the shared spine):

- **Deploying your own container image** → read `references/deploy-oci.md`
- **Deploying a hosted template (fastest path, e.g. a confidential SSH box)** → read `references/hosted-template.md`
- **App already exists — logs, config, domains, unlock/recovery, rollback, destroy, or anything failed/stuck** → read `references/day-2.md`

For *understanding* the platform (what a TEE proves, who can read what, threat model),
the `enclava-concepts` skill is the right tool. For *independently verifying* a running
app's trust properties, use `enclava-verify`.

## Triage quick table

| Symptom | Meaning / first move |
| --- | --- |
| Deploy stalls; `status` shows `tee_error: … Read-only file system (os error 30)` | A `storage.paths` entry isn't a `VOLUME` in the image → add `VOLUME`, redeploy. |
| First deploy in auto mode is rejected | Expected — deploy password-mode first. |
| `portable_verification_material_unavailable` | CAP couldn't assemble portable signature/provenance material. One common cause is a cosign 2.x legacy `.sig` object without portable DSSE material; re-signing with the generated cosign 3.x workflow fixes that case. Registry/referrer errors, missing provenance, malformed bundles, and size limits share this code — inspect the signature and provenance objects before concluding. |
| `status` shows `Status: drifted` after a failed deploy | Follow-up deploys won't roll — `destroy --app <name> --force`, then `create` + `deploy` clean. |
| Claim returns `already_claimed` on a *new* app | Stale escrow (see above) — recover with the old mnemonic. |
| `destroy` returns `app mutation already in progress` (409) | An in-flight deployment holds the mutation lease — wait for it to finish (check `status`), then retry. |
| Browser rejects the app cert (`ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID`) | Some environments serve a Let's Encrypt staging cert — a platform toggle, not an app fault. |
| Unlock "did not complete" right after a deploy | The background unlock may still be running — trust `enclava status` over the CLI exit message. |

## Going deeper

Concepts, architecture, and full reference live in the Enclava developer docs
(https://docs.enclava.dev — also in this repo under `docs/`). Prefer them for *what*
something is; prefer this skill for *how* to operate it.
